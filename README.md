# Train Scheduler
A train schedule program for Assignment 7 of the University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp.

## Overview
Hop aboard Magical railways to reach your ultimate destination! This assignment utilizes a cloud based database, Google Firestore, in order to provide the user a fictional schedule. The next train arrival time is calculated with MomentJS, a Javascript library that allows for the easy manipulation of datetime objects. Each train stop relates to the location in the children's game Candyland, but feel free to add your own! Once a train is added, the database will update in real time and the information will be accessible by every visitor to the site

## Coding Practices
The technologies employed include HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, the MomentJS NPM Package, and Google Firebase.
